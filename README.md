# n8n-nodes-readpdfform

Extends the base ReadPDf node with the ability to extract Form data. Removed the pdf-parse library and works directly with more recent version of pdfjs-dist.

There is also a corresponding [writePdfForm](https://github.com/nzidol/n8n-nodes-writepdfform) node to generate filled out forms.
